class Car:
    def __init__(self,manufacturer:str,year:int,model:str):
    self.manufacturer = manufacturer
    self.year = year
    self.model = model




Given the current class, we see that manufacturer will be hinted for us as an str, and year will be hinted as an int.
It will not crash your code if you ignore it, only if it can't use the other instances.
