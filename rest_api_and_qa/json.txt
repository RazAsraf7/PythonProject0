JSON - JavaScript Object Notation

JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data

JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand


Json is written as Python dictionary. Two main differences between Python's dictionary and Json:
The first is that in Python you write True and in Json you write true.
The second is that in Python you write None and in Json you write null.

This example is a JSON string:

'{"name":"John", "age":30, "car":null}'

It defines an object with 3 properties:

name
age
car
Each property has a value.

If you parse the JSON string with a JavaScript program, you can access the data as an object:

let personName = obj.name;
let personAge = obj.age;
