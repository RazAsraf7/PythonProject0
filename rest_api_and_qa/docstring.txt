When defining a function in Python, it will be usable to have a multiple line string (''' ''')
of the usage in this function. It will be easier to understand for anyone using it later.

def example(a):
    """
    This function returns the inserted argument with hello before.
    a : the argument of the user
    return: type str
    """
    return 'Hello' + a
